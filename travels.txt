My favorite trip was definitely my honeymoon.
My partner and I spent a week in Amsterdam, then a week in London.
Neither of us had ever been to Europe and it was amazing to take in
the different cultures of the Netherlands and the UK, as well as eat some
delicious local food.  Our travel often revolves around eating 😁.
